# YOLOv2 in PyTorch
Another PyTorch implementation of YOLOv2 object detection algorithm. 
I tried to make it a bit cleaner than some other implementations.
* There is a Jupyter notebook that you can use to test your own images or run the pretrained models on your camera.
* I tested this on PyTorch 0.4.1 but it should also work with 0.4.0.
* Training is not implemented. I started working on it but I never got to finish it.
* <b>
    You need to download pretrained weights in order to run the notebook. You can download them here: <br />
